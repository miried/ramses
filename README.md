Ramses is an open source code to model astrophysical systems, featuring self-gravitating, magnetised, compressible, radiative fluid flows. It is based  on the Adaptive Mesh Refinement (AMR)  technique on a  fully-threaded graded octree. 
Ramses is written in  Fortran 90 and is making intensive use of the Message Passing Interface (MPI) library.


> [!WARNING] 
> Ramses recently moved to a new [Github](https://github.com/ramses-organisation/ramses) repository, more information about the change [here](https://ramses.cnrs.fr/ramses-moves-to-github/).
